# Data-Mining
Applied algorithms of Data Mining to get some useful information.

Objective - 
Market Basket Analysis

Implemented the apriori algorithm and the brute force method and compare the brute force method with the Apriori algorithm on each of the 5 transaction databases created. Presented computation (CPU or clock) time to demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm is faster than the brute force method on each of the 
5 transaction databases. The brute force method and Apriori algorithm have generated output of the same association rules on each database.
